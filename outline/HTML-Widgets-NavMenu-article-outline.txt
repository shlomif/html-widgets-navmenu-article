* Common Patterns in Navigation Menus and Site Flow
    - A Tree of Pages
    - Expansion and unexpansion. (based on the current location)
    - Next/Prev/Up links to traverse a site.
    - Site maps.
    - Breadcrumbs trail.
    - Hidden Pages (pages that appear in the site flow, but not in the
    navigation menu).
    - Skipped Pages (page that appear in the navigation menu, but not in
    the site flow).

* Introducing HTML::Widgets::NavMenu
    - A CPAN module.
    - Supports all these patterns (and some other ones)
    - A comprehensive Test suite.
    - Still actively maintained.

* A simple example - a navigation menu with a home page and two sub pages.

* A more complex example with more pages (but no added flare).
