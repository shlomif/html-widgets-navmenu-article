<h2>What are Web-site Navigation Menus?</h2>

<p>
Navigation menus are a group of links given at one side of the page that allows
one to navigate to different places of a web-site. Navigation menus allow 
visitors of one's site to explore other pages of the site, and to find
what they want more easily. As such, they can be a useful addition to one's 
web-site.
</p>

<p>
The web is not short of examples for navigation menus. A simple navigation menu made out of images can be found on <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul 
Graham's homepage</a>. One can see that it doesn't change as the site visitor
move to different pages of the site. A more sophisticated one can be found
on <a href="http://www.kde.org/">the homepage of the KDE desktop environment.</a>. There we see that if we press on 
<a href="http://www.kde.org/screenshots/">the link to the screenshots</a> we
get a sub-menu with the different KDE versions with which the screenshots were
taken. Similar expansions and un-expansions of the menu are present for some 
of its other items.
</p>

<h2>Common Patterns in Navigation Menus and Site Flow</h2>

<p>
One can identify several patterns in maintaining navigation menus and general
site flow.
</p>

<h3>A Tree of Items</h3>

<p>
Usually, the items in the navigation menus are organized in a tree (as is the
case for the KDE site) or a flat list. Sometimes, branches of the tree can
<b>expand</b> or un-expand depending on the current page. This is done so the
entire tree won't be displayed at once.
</p>

<h3>Next/Previous/Up Links to Traverse a Site</h3>

<p>
Many sites provide links to traverse the pages of the site in order: A 
<b>"Next" Link</b> to go to the next page, a <b>"Previous" Link</b> to go 
to the previous page, an <b>"Up" link</b> to go to the section containing the
current page, a <b>"Contents" link</b> to go to the main page, and so on.
</p>

<p>
These link can be implemented using the HTML <tt>&lt;head&gt;</tt> tag 
<tt>&lt;link rel="next" href="" /&gt;</tt>. directives. These in turn are
supported by Mozilla, Mozilla Firefox and Opera. Or they can be visible in 
the HTML.
